<h3>Front end dev projects made by me using ReactJS </h3>

<h1>Quick Start</h1>

  -Install dependencies<br>
     npm install

  -Serve on localhost:3000<br>
     npm start

  -Build for production<br>
     npm run build.

    
   After Installing the dependencies, You can clone the Repo or Download the Zip code and add the "src" code files to your project file and you are all set to go.
